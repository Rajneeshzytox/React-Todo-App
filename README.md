# Todo App with Vite, React, TailwindCSS, and DaisyUI

This project is a Todo application built to learn and demonstrate the fundamentals of React. The app is developed using Vite, React, TailwindCSS, and DaisyUI. It covers essential React concepts such as components, props, rendering components using the `map` function, and editing arrays of objects in state.

## Features

- **Component-based architecture**: The app is structured using reusable React components.
- **Props**: Passing data between components using props.
- **Rendering with `map`**: Dynamically rendering components by iterating over arrays with the `map` function.
- **State management**: Managing and editing arrays of objects in the component state.
- **Styling**: Styled using TailwindCSS and DaisyUI for a modern and responsive design.

## Technologies Used

- **Vite**: For fast and efficient development.
- **React**: The core library for building the user interface.
- **TailwindCSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for styling.
- **DaisyUI**: TailwindCSS components for additional UI elements.
